#Medusa

Basilisk II is an Open Source [68k Macintosh emulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Macintosh_platform_emulators): it allows you to run 68K Mac OS software on your computer in a different operating system. SheepShaver does a similar job, but it emulates a Power Macintosh instead of a 68K.

Both emulators were developed by Christian Bauer and improved by a large open-source community. SheepShaver was much improved by the efforts of Gwenole Beauchesne.

Notwithstanding the success of these emulators, they can be a bit messy to set up. The original applications were developed for Amiga OS and later ported to Linux before making their way into Mac OS X. The developers made several tools to manage the settings for these emulators, but they are ugly, counter intuitive and allow users to work with only one virtual machine at a time.

This is where *Medusa* comes in:

Medusa is a modern Cocoa-based manager that allows the creation of [virtual machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) to be easily manipulated and used by Mac OS X users. It will not create invisible files in your home folder, it will not force you to edit preferences files manually or force you to read technical details in abandoned websites. All you need is here, elegantly packed in this application and its documentation.

Please refer to [Basilisk's official website](http://basilisk.cebix.net/) and to [SheepShaver's official website](http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/) for more information on these emulators.

Please refer to [Medusa's changelog page](http://medusa.mariot.me.uk) for download of the compiled versions of all releases and detailed description of each of them.
