  <h1>The Assets Manager Window</h1>
</div>
<p>
  Assets, in Medusa, are files and applications used to set the virtual machines up. The basic files necessary are ROM image files, disk image files and emulator applications.
</p>
<div class="centre">
  <img src="assets/img/AssetsManager.jpg" />
</div>
<p>
  Medusa offers you a tool to organise these files. The <strong>Assets Manager</strong> window is divided in four tabs: "Drop Area", "Rom Images", "Disk Images" and "Emulators".
</p>

<hr />
<a name="emulators"></a>

<h2>Emulators supported</h2>
<p>
  The only emulators supported by Medusa are <a href="http://basilisk.cebix.net" target="_blank">Basilisk II</a> and <a href="http://sheepshaver.cebix.net" target="_blank">SheepShaver</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Basilisk II was developed using a Macintosh Quadra 950 as blueprint, although any of Apple's gestalt ids can be reported to the guest operating system. It emulates the Motorola processors that belong to the 68000 family.
</p>
<p>
  SheepShaver was developed following the Power Macintosh 9500, but it doesn't necessarily emulates this particular model, since it emulates Quickdraw Acceleration, which was available only in a later model.
</p>
<p>
  Both emulators need a ROM image to be able to run. The ROM image is then patched and the calls made to the hardware are redirected to the host system. Some aspects of Basilisk and SheepShaver are not entirely emulated, such as disk images: they behave like big diskettes instead of hard drives.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't know where to download the emulators or are not in the mood for that, Medusa can download and organise them for you.
</p>
<p>
  To do that, simply click the "download automatically" button at the Emulators tab. Medusa will then download different binaries for both Basilisk II and SheepShaver and then assemble the application files in its Application Support directory.
</p>

</div>
<div class="centre">
  <img src="assets/img/DownloadEmulators.jpg" />
</div>
<p>
  If you accidentally delete one of these emulators from the list, simply hit the "refresh" button, so they will be identified and added to the list again.
</p>
<p>
  You can also locate the emulator application by clicking the magnifier button and add your own version of Basilisk II and SheepShaver to be used with Medusa.
</p>

<div class="warning">
  <p>
    Please note: if you are using a retina display, you must set the emulators to run in low resolution before using them. If you do not do it, they will work at half the resolution intended.
  </p>
</div>

<hr />
<a name="rom"></a>

<h2>ROM files supported</h2>
<p>
  Any ROM files extracted from a Macintosh computer prior to Apple's move towards Mac OS X can be recognised by Medusa. But since the ROMs are essentially different, some of them will not work with any of the emulators. Medusa will give you some details whenever it is possible about the ROM file you have. These details may prove useful to increase the stability of your virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
  To add a ROM image to Medusa, simply drag &amp; drop the file into the list, or click the "add" button.
</p>
<p>
  You can also locate the file by clicking the magnifier button.
</p>

</div>

<hr />
<a name="disk"></a>

<h2>Disk image files supported.</h2>
<p>
  Medusa supports any disk image with the following extensions: <strong>dmg</strong>, <strong>img</strong>, <strong>iso</strong>, <strong>hfv</strong> and <strong>dsk</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The disks supported by the emulated machines are probably formatted with <strong>HFS</strong>, <strong>HFS+</strong>, <strong>ISO 9660</strong> (read-only) and <strong>FAT</strong> (no boot) file-systems. Any other file-system may not work. Medusa can trace the existence of the following file-systems: <strong>LisaFS</strong>, <strong>MFS</strong>, <strong>HFS</strong>, <strong>HFS+</strong>, <strong>ISO 9660</strong> and <strong>FAT</strong>. This doesn't imply the emulation is going to work with these file-systems.
</p>
<p>
  To add a Disk image files to Medusa, simply drag &amp; drop the file into the list, or click the "add" button.
</p>
<p>
  You can also locate the file by clicking the magnifier button.

<hr />
<a name="drop"></a>

<h2>The Drop Area.</h2>
<p>
  The Drop Area tab is intended to make things easier. It will try to parse any type of files or folder contents and if Medusa identifies Rom images, Disk images and valid emulators, it will add them to its database. To use it, simply drag &amp; drop any files of folders with valid files inside the drop zone. Medusa will give a quick feedback in the end.
